# Bill of Materials
### DHT11 Temperature Humidity Sensor $5.99 (for two of them)
### Arduino UNO Rev3. $27.6
### Gikfun Momentary SMD PCB Switch $8.68

# Implementation Details 
### I captured the position of the specific color of object to change the timbre. The career signal generated by additive synth that is consist of pixeles of movie.

### The size and Dry/Wet of reverb is controled by Temperature and Humidity sensor.he data from sensor is going to Max/MSP through Arduino/Teensy. This time, my Teensy was not recognized by arduino IDE and I swtiched my board to Arduino UNO. But the sensor itself sometimes work but most of the time doesn't work for some reason. So in this version, you don't need to use the ultrasonic sensor.

### To track the object as much as possible, I combined color detection and gesture follower. As a result, the system recognized color and movement of them at the same time.
### Blue is operating Both career or modulator signal with Low pass filter. Green is about amount of Frequency Modulation.
### Eventually, I want to add each function and FX for rest of the button (Red, Yellow, and Black).
