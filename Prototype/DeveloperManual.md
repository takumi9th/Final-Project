# Bill of Materials
### Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - 3V or 5V - RCWL-1601 $3.95
### Arduino UNO Rev3. $27.6

# Implementation Details 
### I captured the position of the hand to change the timbre. The career signal generated by additive synth that is consist of pixeles of movie.
### The size of reverb should be controled by ultrasonic sensor but it doesn't work. The data from sensor is going to Max/MSP through Arduino/Teensy. This time, my Teensy was not recognized by arduino IDE and I swtiched my board to Arduino UNO. But the sensor itself sometimes work but most of the time doesn't work for some reason.
### When your hand is outside of frame, they lose the tracking. And you need to re-register your hand.
### For the next step, I'll do color tracking or light tracking to follow the position more easilly without clicking the mouse. I'll exchange the sensor for the reverb.
